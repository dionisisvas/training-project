            <p>This an intern training project we are working on at IRI in order to get acquainted with the tools used by the company, as well as good programming practices.</p>
            <p>The goal is to learn about the MVC pattern and RESTful APIs; to this end, we use an SQLite database with mock data and build a service around it. Right now you can 
            view a <a href="user">user list</a>, add a <a href="create/user">new one</a>, or view a user's detailed info.</p>
            <p>We use Java 8 and Spring at the back-end and JavaScript, Bootstrap and AngularJs at the front-end. Various other libraries are used; for an extensive list check the README
            distributed with the source code.</p>
