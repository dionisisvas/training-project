The Java back-end connects to an SQLite db to fetch a user; an instance of it is created using the builder pattern.

The AngularJS front-end provides routing, animations and displays the JSON data.

The project is ready to be built; after building, use `jetty:run` to start the jetty servlet and connect at `localhost:8080/spring`
