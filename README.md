The Java back-end connects to an SQLite db to fetch a user; an instance of it is created using the builder pattern.

The AngularJS front-end provides routing, animations and displays the JSON data.

The project is ready to be built. After building, use `jetty:run` as a command line parameter with IntelliJ, or `mvn jetty:run` at the CL to start the jetty servlet. Finally, connect at `localhost:8080/spring`.
